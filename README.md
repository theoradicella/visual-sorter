Welcome!

Sorting algorithms are fascinating ðŸ¤¯ and we all enjoy to visualize them in action.

You can select your favorite algorithm, change the speed as fast (or slow) as you want, set the size of the array to sort and start visualizing.

Once the sort starts, you'll need to wait until it finishes to customize the sorter.

Have fun!
